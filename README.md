# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **end-to-end machine learning solution** for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. It integrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of **multiple Machine Learning classification models** to analyze survival patterns and compare model performance.

The aim is to transform raw passenger data into meaningful insights, identifying key factors that influenced survival and evaluating **seven different algorithms** to determine the most effective predictive approach.

## 📦 Dataset Source

The raw data utilized for this analysis and modeling comes from the following public source:

 [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)


---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Inspected data structure and missing values
- Visualized missing values using heatmaps
- Handled missing data:
  - Filled missing **Age** values using the mean
- Encoded categorical variables into numerical format
- Prepared features and target variable for modeling

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed survival distribution across different features
- Explored relationships between survival and:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age
- Used visualizations to identify patterns and trends in the data

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
A total of **7 classification models** were trained and evaluated:

1. Logistic Regression  
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
4. Decision Tree  
5. Random Forest  
6. Naive Bayes  
7. Gradient Boosting  

All models were trained on the same dataset to ensure a fair comparison.
